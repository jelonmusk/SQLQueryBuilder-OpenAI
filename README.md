# SQLQueryBuilder-OpenAI

SQLQueryBuilder-OpenAI is a full-stack application built with React (frontend) and Node.js + Express (backend).  
It leverages OpenAI's GPT API to dynamically generate SQL queries from natural language prompts.

This project demonstrates modern web development combined with AI-driven SQL query generation, 
making it a great showcase for full-stack and AI integration skills.

---

## Features

- User-friendly React frontend to input natural language query requests.
- Express backend API to handle requests and communicate with OpenAIâ€™s GPT API.
- Dynamically generates optimized SQL queries based on user input.
- Ready for deployment on platforms like Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend).
- Environment variables support for API keys and backend URLs.

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

4. Navigate to the client folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

5. Start the development servers:

* In one terminal, run the backend:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

* In another terminal, run the frontend:

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

6. Open your browser at like : `http://localhost:5173`
